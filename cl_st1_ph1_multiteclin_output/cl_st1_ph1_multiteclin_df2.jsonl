By integrating these digital tools into the teaching process, as was done in the didactic sequence of this researcher\u2019s master\u2019s study, students are exposed to a learning environment that mirrors contemporary social practices, facilitating the transition between the school world and the digital universe they inhabit. The practice of writing and publishing fanfictions on blogs, for example, allows students to practice writing in a meaningful and contextualized way, using English in a functional and relevant manner to their lives.","Text Paragraph ChatGPT":"An important aspect to consider is the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in enhancing the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies.

The intertextuality present in the creation of fanfictions, by working with pre-existing texts, encourages creativity and innovation, while promoting a deeper understanding of the discursive and stylistic norms of the English language. Through practice, students are encouraged to think critically about the writing process, becoming more aware of their linguistic choices and the implications of these choices in meaning-making.","Text Paragraph ChatGPT":"Linguistic affordances are demonstrated by the opportunities students have to experiment with language, exploring various grammatical structures, vocabulary, and writing styles.

Students' thematic and stylistic choices reflected not only their interpretations of canonical texts but also their personal experiences, demonstrating how creative writing can be a powerful tool for identity expression and reflection on social and cultural issues. This aspect reinforces the idea that the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies is not just an approach aimed at language teaching, but also an emancipatory practice that allows students to critically position themselves in relation to the world around them.","Text Paragraph ChatGPT":"The analysis of students' fanfictions highlighted the significance of the sociocultural context in narrative development. The thematic and stylistic choices made by students reflected their interpretations of canonical texts as well as their personal experiences, illustrating how creative writing serves as an effective medium for expressing identity and reflecting on social and cultural issues. This finding supports the notion that the Pedagogy of Multiliteracies extends beyond language teaching to function as an emancipatory practice, enabling students to critically engage with the world around them."}

By embracing the diversity of communication modes and promoting a more inclusive and critical education, this approach expands learning possibilities, preparing students to act effectively and autonomously in an increasingly complex and multimodal world. The presented research demonstrated that by integrating fanfiction production into the pedagogical environment, it is possible not only to promote linguistic development but also to foster critical and participatory engagement that transforms the teaching-learning experience, making it more meaningful and connected to contemporary realities.","Text Paragraph ChatGPT":"The Pedagogy of Multiliteracies, when applied through fanfiction production, presents a promising approach for reconfiguring English language teaching. This method embraces diverse communication modes and promotes a more inclusive and critical educational framework, thereby expanding learning opportunities and preparing students to function effectively and independently in an increasingly complex and multimodal world. The research presented indicates that integrating fanfiction production into the educational setting can enhance linguistic development while also fostering critical and participatory engagement, thereby transforming the teaching-learning experience to be more meaningful and relevant to contemporary contexts."}
